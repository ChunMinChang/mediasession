This branch collects together the early proposals we had for accessing media keys and managing audio focus.

Work in this branch has been discontinued.

The main project can be found at [https://github.com/whatwg/mediasession](https://github.com/whatwg/mediasession).

## Initial Proposals

* [Implicit media focus, key binding, events and overrides](https://github.com/whatwg/mediasession/blob/prespec/ImplicitMediaControls.md) &ndash; a default and declarative proposal that reuses existing features of `HTMLMediaElement` objects.
* [Media focus with channels support, metadata additions and media category overrides](https://github.com/mounirlamouri/media-focus/blob/master/explainer.md) &ndash; improve default media handling and provide channels for both `HTMLMediaElement` and `AudioContext` objects.
* [MediaRemoteControl](https://github.com/whatwg/mediasession/blob/prespec/MediaRemoteControl.md) &ndash; an API proposal to handle all types of media and non-media remote control access.
